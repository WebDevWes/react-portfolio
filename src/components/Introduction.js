    <p>
      My name is Wesley, I've been a tech enthusiast all my life; I love taking
      apart technology to see how things ticks, espescially for older retro tech
      where you can still physically see the things. I have worked in
      distribution for a while and started trying to find ways to automate
      various daily data input tasks; I was able to replicate most of this using
      Excel and copy/paste. In my pursuit to completely automate things it had
      led me towards discovering programming and utilizing API calls and
      database. Programming is quite a rabbit hole that I've jumped in, the
      frustration and various emotions I feel when programming is all worth it
      at the end when I have a functional software that does what I want! I am
      always eager to learn new things, be it new frameworks or even another
      language. The next language I intend to look into would be Python/Django.
      I'm also very open to picking up random projects to work on to improve
      myself!
